# 100days-of-code-w1
starting my 100 days of code with week 1 where i am going to focus on sql with nodejs as apposed to the usual mongodb

read up on client.end() + pools assuming it will save interactions 

getting server up
installing postresql get app and move to applications folder -> attempt to open then go to security settings -> general and allow it to open
also install pgadmin4 for easier testing 

had an issue with node making random files that were named the same as whatever port value i was using so if that happens in .env move the port decloration to the bottom and restart computer and server
(the random files were blocking the ports i was attempting to use) also delete them while doing the step above.
