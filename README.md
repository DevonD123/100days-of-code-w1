# postgreSQL-node-todoAPI
instead of using the the normal mongodb with node i decided to do a tutorial on a sql version of a todolist api i created with postgreSQL, nodejs, express and pg(npm package)

read up on client.end() + pools assuming it will save interactions 

getting server up
installing postresql get app and move to applications folder -> attempt to open then go to security settings -> general and allow it to open
also install pgadmin4 for easier testing 

had an issue with node making random files that were named the same as whatever port value i was using so if that happens in .env move the port decloration to the bottom and restart computer and server
(the random files were blocking the ports i was attempting to use) also delete them while doing the step above.





todo next:----> add another table potentially users table with auth and linking
